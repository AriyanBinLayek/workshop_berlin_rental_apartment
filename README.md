# Workshop on rental prices in Berlin.
## Data
Data is stored in `data`. `final_rent_data.txt`is the data you get by web scraping some website.

## Notebooks
You will find your notebooks in `notebooks/`. In case you feel it is too complicated or you stack on some step, you can find a solution notebook in `solutions/`


## Work
1. Clean data using your creativity. Use `cleaning_data_student_notebook` and the `data/final_rent_data.txt` (it is the data you get by webscraping), the output of your work should be a file similar to `cleaned_data.txt`.
2. Webscrap wikipedia (use `webscraping_student_notebook`)
3. Use google matrix API to calculate the trip duration
